nclock is a small program that turns your terminal into a digital style clock.
Use of the included makefile is pretty easy; `make all` will make the 'nclock'
executable in the working directory and `make install` will copy the
executable to the directory contained by the 'INSTALLDIR' variable at the top
of the makefile. By default, nclock installs itself to '~/bin'.
